# coding-quiz

I created this project because I wanted to weave together what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  While the HTML and CSS is more skeleton I use various Javascript functions in order to make this quiz work.  This project forced me to take what I had learned about Javascript and apply it to a real life application.  A lot of what I had previously done in Javascript was primarily console based but this project showed me the power of utilizing Javascript and its many fuctions.  Below you will find a link to my deployed page as well as a screenshot of the homepage.
